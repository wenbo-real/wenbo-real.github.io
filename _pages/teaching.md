## 2024 Fall

#### [IS 218. Building Web Applications. 3 credits, 3 contact hours (3;0;0)](https://catalog.njit.edu/search/?P=IS%20218)

This course provides a critical, hands-on introduction to the design of Web-based Information Systems. We will explore and discuss emerging trends, capabilities, and limitations of web technologies used to capture, store, access, and disseminate information for both businesses and online communities. Students, working in groups, will design and develop different types of web applications, which will then be analyzed and critiqued by the students as to their usability in actual public and private settings. An open-source web content management system will be utilized throughout the course.

Prerequisites: (IS 117 or IT 202) and (CS 100, CS 113, or CS 115). 


## 2025 Fall

#### [CPSCI-101: Computer Science for All](https://hamilton.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2020-21/college-catalogue/academicprograms/computer-science/computer-science-courses)

The first course in computer science is an introduction to algorithmic problem-solving using the Python programming language. Topics include primitive data types, mathematical operations, structured programming with conditional and iterative idioms, functional abstraction, and objects. Students apply these skills in writing programs to solve problems in domains across the liberal arts. No previous programming experience necessary.

#### [CPSCI-410: Senior Seminar](https://hamilton.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2020-21/college-catalogue/academicprograms/computer-science/computer-science-courses)

Practicum in which teams of students provide computer expertise and support for faculty research projects. Topics include software engineering analysis, design, coding, testing, maintenance, and documentation.

Prerequisites: CPSCI 210, 220 and 240
